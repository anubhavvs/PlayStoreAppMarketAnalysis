# PlayStoreAppMarketAnalysis

A Data Analysis project with Python using the Google App Store Market Data. I have tried to make a project with the statistics for over 9000 apps on the Play Store. Topic of analysis:<br />

* Exploring all 33 different App Categories.<br />
* Distribution of the App Ratings over the 9000 Apps<bvr />
* How the Price and Size of an App affect Ratings of the app?<br />
* Relation between App Category and App Price<br />
* Popularity of Paid Apps vs Free Apps<br />
* Sentiment of User Reviews<br />
